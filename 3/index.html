              <h1 id="Talk-about-Apple-WWDC-2020"><a href="#Talk-about-Apple-WWDC-2020" class="headerlink" title="Talk about Apple WWDC 2020"></a>Talk about Apple WWDC 2020</h1><p>Apple has released a lot of meaningful new features this time at WWDC. Whether it is for iOS, iPadOS or macOS, telling the truth is a big year. Compared with last year’s highlight of iOS, the fancy revision is not as good as it looks. This year’s new features are obviously more cross-epoch.</p>
<p>I am very happy to see that Apple has started to build its own unified framework for all platforms based on ARM. The integration of Apple’s ecological applications brought by this framework is believed to bring unpredictable superposition effects. In the current rich iOS ecosystem, this flattening action makes the benefits of macOS far greater than the previous Catalyst that requires developer access.</p>
<p>Looking back, we found that in the matter of ARM, Apple is far more radical than Microsoft. Windows has been trying to do ARM support since the early years of RT. After so many years of going down the road, even the latest Windows ARM version, support is still not ideal. Let’s not talk about the technical level for the time being. The two historical issues of compatibility and control over the ARM architecture, I think it is the reason that Windows has been unable to achieve good results in supporting ARM.</p>
<p>Today Apple can start turning to ARM and abandon Intel/AMD. The most basic point is that Apple’s highly customized ARM and the resulting system-level integration. This is like the x86 alliance that Microsoft and Intel established in the past. The difference is that this time Apple’s company’s volume and technology are sufficient to complete comprehensive support, and there is no need to hook up with other companies to co-create technology.</p>
<p>Apple’s conference today said that ARM is the future. In the past few years, due to x86 x64’s main Intel has been squeezing toothpaste, ARM has eaten up a large number of markets, and the development of mobile terminals and battery technology bottlenecks have made Intel The disadvantages in the field of personal devices gradually emerged, which ultimately led to the situation where ARM we see today occupy the mobile market and gradually expand.</p>
<p>However, ARM also has its own problems, such as the high degree of integration for mobile terminals, which makes it lack of customization and support of basic hardware interfaces compared to the x86 framework. The mainstream ARMs we can currently buy are highly integrated. What you need to change to a GPU is not to go out and buy a graphics card, but to need a FAB to help you customize the ARM chip you need, and then find a IDH. Starting from the motherboard to help you build a little platform, although more can be reused as you go up, the overall cost is still far from the convenient replacement of the graphics card under the x86 framework. This is also the reason why Taobao’s black apple store began to wailing after Apple announced today. In two years, this business can only be said to be a small sum of money.</p>
<p>But the future is full of infinite possibilities, just like the South Bridge and North Bridge that were born in the past, maybe ARM will also have its own customized solutions with the support of Apple, although according to Apple’s consistent style we finally saw the ARM machine It may be a complete customized machine, but there is always hope. Now that Apple and AMD are not so close, maybe a new PC era belonging to ARM is coming.</p>
<p>To pull it back, to say a little bit more, ARM has a big difference from the instruction set in terms of x86. In simple terms, ARM does very fine and broken things, x86 does very big and big things, and in a core clock Both of these CPUs can only do one thing. So no matter how powerful QEMU is, x86 running on ARM can still only get the efficiency of dividing the CPU core by 3 and dividing by 4. The efficiency of UTM on iOS and Qemu emulator on Android running Windows are both terrible. Whether Apple will try to solve some problems by extending the ARM instruction set this time is actually very exciting.</p>
<p>Linux and Docker were shown during Apple’s demonstration of compatibility this time. What about Windows? What about BootCamp? Now that Parallels is supported, Windows virtual machines are inevitable, but how efficient are they? In my opinion, if Apple’s compatibility strategy is a pure software layer, it will never deviate from Qemu’s thinking. If it is to be a hardware layer, the ARM Mac mini that can be bought today may not be reflected, after all, it is the A12Z core. It is likely that it is the same as the old iPad Pro, but it may also be that Apple hid it when it did the A12Z before and said that it is ready to today. Personally, I am not optimistic about the practice of emulating x86 on ARM. Although the ecosystem of macOS is about to be greatly enriched because of ARM, the necessity of Windows is still very high now. There is no Boot Camp and Windows virtual machine. How much is the value of macOS, I can only give a question mark.</p>
<p>The above balabala is a little messy, and it is all related to ARM. In fact, there are many things to talk about here, such as iOS/iPadOS, too late today, the elderly are going to sleep, and are free Say again.</p>
<p>Finally, a little regret about WWDC this time, that is AR. Throughout the speech, only one iPadOS mentioned ARKit upgrade to the 4th generation, and the rest was not mentioned. I believe there will definitely be a lot of press releases touting Apple’s abandonment of VR tomorrow. I can only regret this. It may be that the content of WWDC is too full this time, and I have no time to talk about AR. And for this kind of “Keynote movie”, if you show AR, it may be considered as a post-special effect, after all, a company Special effects financing is ahead.</p>
<p>I personally think that Apple may be staying in the big trick with AR. WWDC does not send hardware. Will the legendary Apple Glasses be released in September? Wait for me to download iOS 14 and explore it, maybe the answer is in it. It’s like the iPhone X Apple didn’t say anything when it was at WWDC, and finally gave a month to adapt after the press conference. Maybe this year’s Apple big move is still behind.</p>
